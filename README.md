- **22 January 2024**: Release.

## üî• ONNX Export & Inference

We provide a simple command-line tool [`dynamo.py`](dynamo.py) based on [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) to export Depth Anything V2 to ONNX and PyTorch2 programs. Please install the [requirements](/requirements.txt) first.

```shell
$ python dynamo.py --help

 Usage: dynamo.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

If you would like to try out inference right away, you can download ONNX models that have already been exported [here](https://github.com/fabio-sim/Depth-Anything-ONNX/releases).

We observe the following average latencies using the CUDA Execution Provider:

| Device | Encoder | Input Shape | Average Latency (ms) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RTX4080 12GB | ViT-S | `(1, 3, 518, 518)` | 13.3 |
| RTX4080 12GB | ViT-B | `(1, 3, 518, 518)` | 29.3 |
| RTX4080 12GB | ViT-L | `(1, 3, 518, 518)` | 83.2 |

Relevant framework versions:
```text
CUDA==12.1
cuDNN==8.9.2
onnxruntime-gpu==1.18.0
torch==2.3.1
```

### Export Example

> [!TIP]
> You can view the available options at any time by passing `--help`.

```bash
python dynamo.py export --encoder vitb --output weights/vitb.onnx --opset 17
```

For dynamic shapes:

```bash
python dynamo.py export --encoder vitb -b 0 -h 0 -w 0
```

#### Export via TorchDynamo Example

> [!CAUTION]
> The TorchDynamo-based ONNX Exporter is a new beta feature that may undergo breaking changes in the future. Currently, only static shapes and opset version 18 are supported.

```bash
python dynamo.py export --encoder vitb --output weights/vitb.onnx --use-dynamo -h 1036 -w 1036
```

### Inference Example

```bash
python dynamo.py infer weights/vitb.onnx -i assets/sacre_coeur1.jpg
```

This function serves as an implementation reference for performing inference with only ONNXRuntime and OpenCV as dependencies.

## üî• ONNX Export

Prior to exporting the ONNX models, please install the [requirements](/requirements.txt).

To convert the Depth Anything models to ONNX, run [`export.py`](/export.py). The pretrained weights will be downloaded automatically.

<details>
<summary>Export Example</summary>
<pre>
python export.py --model s
</pre>
</details>

If you would like to try out inference right away, you can download ONNX models that have already been exported [here](https://github.com/fabio-sim/Depth-Anything-ONNX/releases).

## ‚ö° ONNX Inference

With ONNX models in hand, one can perform inference on Python using ONNX Runtime. See [`infer.py`](/infer.py).

<details>
<summary>Inference Example</summary>
<pre>
python infer.py --img assets/DSC_0410.JPG --model weights/depth_anything_vits14.onnx --viz
</pre>
</details>


## ‚è±Ô∏è Inference Time Comparison

<p align="center"><img src="assets/latency.png" alt="Latency Comparison" width=90%>

We report the inference time, or latency, of only the model; that is, the time taken for preprocessing, postprocessing, or copying data between the host & device is not measured. The average inference time is defined as the median over all samples in the [MegaDepth](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00607) test dataset. We use the data provided by [LoFTR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00680) [here](https://github.com/zju3dv/LoFTR/blob/master/docs/TRAINING.md) - a total of 806 images.

Each image is resized such that its size is 518x518 before being fed into the model. The inference time is then measured for all model variants (S, B, L). See [eval.py](/eval.py) for the measurement code.

All experiments are conducted on an i9-12900HX CPU and RTX4080 12GB GPU with `CUDA==11.8.1`, `torch==2.1.2`, and `onnxruntime==1.16.3`.

### Notes

- Currently, the inference speed is bottlenecked by Conv operations.
- ONNXRuntime performs slightly (20-25%) faster for the ViT-L model variant.
